## Hi there 👋

SportsIn aims to solve the information dispersion problem in sports events. I'm talking about every kind of event: from your kiddo's/nephew/neese/whatever under-12 lacrosse game to the final of the Champions League.

Currently, this information is all over the place: on live score applications, Facebook pages, Instagram pages, obscure clubs websites that still have that 2000s UI, you name it. We want to end that: one platform for all.

How, you ask?

1. Web application for clubs, regional associations, or federations to create events. Developed with Django.
2. Mobile application for people to consume those events. Developed with Flutter.
3. Commercial website for people to know about us. Developed with Astro.

We are almost there: the mobile application MVP is done, and the web application MVP is 90% done.

You can check our webiste here: [SportsIn website](https://sportsin.app/) (still only in Portuguese, I know. Working on that).
